              I was a bit nervous to be buying a secondhand phone from Amazon,
              but I couldnâ€™t be happier with my purchase!! I have a pre-paid
              data plan so I was worried that this phone wouldnâ€™t connect with
              my data plan, since the new phones donâ€™t have the physical Sim
              tray anymore, but couldnâ€™t have been easier! I bought an Unlocked
              black iPhone 14 Pro Max in excellent condition and everything is
              PERFECT. It was super easy to set up and the phone works and looks
              great. It truly was in excellent condition. Highly recommend!!!ðŸ–¤
